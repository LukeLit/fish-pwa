# Visual Motifs and Special Effects for Fish Art Prompts

## Overview
This document catalogs visual motifs and special effects that can be used as prompt chunks for fish art generation. These motifs add variety and thematic depth, and can be referenced by fish, upgrades, fusions, or mutations.

## Example Motifs
- Bioluminescent spots
- Glowing veins
- Toxic sludge
- Radioactive slime
- Armored scales
- Spiked fins
- Crystal growths
- Eldritch glow
- Cybernetic implants
- Rusted metal plates
- Coral encrustations
- Mossy patches
- Electric sparks
- Shadowy aura
- Translucent skin
- Extra eyes
- Tentacle appendages
- Fractured armor
- Iridescent shimmer

## Usage
- Motifs can be assigned to fish, upgrades, or mutations as a separate field (`visualMotif`)
- Multiple motifs can be combined for fusions or advanced upgrades
- Motifs are used as prompt chunks during art generation and can be previewed/selected in editor tools

## Future Expansion
- Add new motifs as new biomes, upgrades, or mutations are introduced
- Consider controlled vocabulary for consistency, or allow free-text for creative flexibility

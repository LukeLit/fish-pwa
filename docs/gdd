Fish Odyssey PWA Roguelite - Updated One-Pager
Epic single-player fish-eat-fish roguelite with incremental meta-progression: Start as a tiny surreal mutant in procedural ocean depths, devour generative prey to grow & mutate, hit mutagen events for spine-rigged evolutions, then warp to space devouring asteroids/nebulae—die & earn Essence for permanent upgrades. Inspired by DiceVaders' strategic run unlocks/big-number scoring & Shelldiver's cozy branching skill tree/shop loops: Clean UI with meta hub for tech tree (e.g., +growth speed, unlock warp fins, biome perks), run summaries, and trivialized early phases over time. Procedural runs via seeds for replayability, PWA offline play, fxhash-mintable unique evolutions. Optional story FTUE: Quick fish tank intro for tutorial/first run. Hyper-realistic surrealist painted style for assets, leveraging AI for high-quality procedural generation.
Core Loop: Launch run → Eat/grow/mutate through phases → Score Essence on death/high-score → Spend in meta tree → Stronger runs. WASD movement, auto-eat smaller fish, dodge giants.
Roguelite: Per-run powerups (temp mutations, speed bursts) lost on death; random events/bosses per phase; procedural layouts/food/enemies.
Incremental/Meta: Essence buys branching tree (e.g., Ocean Mastery: faster growth; Mutagen Perks: evolution magnets; Space Unlocks: planet-eater mode). Numbers scale hugely—unlock hyper-mutants, infinite growth caps.
AI-Enhanced Procedural Assets Research Insights:
Deep dives via web/X searches reveal robust AI integration for surreal, high-quality assets beyond base procedural code—focus on hyper-realistic surrealist painted styles (e.g., warped mutants with oily brushstrokes, dreamlike distortions). For fish: Generate base sprites/models offline with AI, then proceduralize variations in-game via params (e.g., seed-driven warps). Tencent's Hunyuan stands out as top-tier for free, high-res 3D/2D generation from text/images/sketches—e.g., prompt "hyper-realistic surrealist painted mutant fish with perlin-warped fins, oily textures" to create PBR-ready assets importable as sprites. Alternatives: Stable Diffusion's Realistic Vision for photorealism, Flux models (FLUX.1 Kontext Max) for surreal art, Chimera Painter (Google) for creature iteration, SeaArt/OpenArt for text-to-asset. For ocean: AI pre-gens textures (caustics, nebulae) via Deep Dream Generator (psychedelic waves) or Recraft (surreal seascapes), then apply in shaders; HunyuanWorld 1.0 builds entire procedural scenes from prompts like "infinite surreal ocean with god rays and floating particles." X discussions highlight prompts for underwater VFX (e.g., volumetric lighting, caustics via triplanar projection) and AI VFX tools like Kling AI/Runway for dynamic swarms. Integrate: Offline AI baking for asset packs, in-game procedural tweaks for uniqueness; low-VRAM options like Hunyuan3D (Apache-licensed) ensure accessibility.
Tech Stack:

Framework/Deployment: Next.js (via Vercel Boilerplate template for easy setup/deploy) + next-pwa for PWA manifest/service worker (offline caching, installable app)
Canvas/Rendering: p5.js (loop, UI menus, particles/boids) – wrapped in React components for Next.js integration
Fish Gen/Anim: fishdraw polylines + perlin/sine spine bones; AI integration: Hunyuan3D/Image (Tencent) for base surreal mutant sprites (text-to-3D/2D, hyper-real painted style), Chimera Painter for creature variants; GLSL shaders for surreal effects (Kuwahara brushstrokes, glows, Deep Dream-like distortions)
Ocean Gen: Perlin/Worley noise for waves/ripples/caustics; AI pre-gen: HunyuanWorld/Stable Diffusion (Flux) for procedural textures (surreal depths, god rays, particulate); Matter.js for water physics sim
Roguelite ProcGen: Seeded noise/fxrand() for spawns/events/phases; simple A* pathing for enemies; AI-seeded params (e.g., Recraft/Leonardo.Ai prompts for biome variations)
Physics/Effects: Matter.js lite (collisions); particles for chomps/mutagens
UI/Meta: p5.js buttons/sliders or dat.gui; branching tech tree as node graph; localStorage for Essence/upgrades/run HBs
Audio: Howler.js (bites, cosmic hums)
PWA/Meta: Service worker offline; IndexedDB/localStorage saves; run prestige resets temp for Essence burst
Blockchain: fxhash Tezos—mint run-captured eternal mutant fish as animated tokens
AI Asset Pipeline: Offline: Hunyuan (free 3D/2D gen), Midjourney/Stable Diffusion for surreal painted assets; import as image arrays for procedural tint/warp in p5.js

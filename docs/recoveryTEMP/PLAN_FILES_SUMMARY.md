## Plan Files That Exist in Repo

- `docs/plans/LEVEL-REFACTOR/` - Various level refactor plans (not related to combat system)

## Notes

- The copypasta shows that plan files were discussed but may not have been created in the repo
- The extracted snippets contain the content that would have been in these plan files
- The Cursor plan file (`health_combat_and_hit_impact_396f7e4c.plan.md`) is the most complete plan document available
- Content from the missing plan files can be found in `extracted-code-snippets-v2.md` under the respective file sections

## Recommendation

When reconstructing the work:
1. Use `health_combat_and_hit_impact_396f7e4c.plan.md` as the primary plan reference
2. Check `extracted-code-snippets-v2.md` for any additional plan content that was discussed but not saved
3. The extracted snippets contain the actual implementation details that may not be in the plan files

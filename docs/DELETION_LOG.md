# Code Deletion Log

## Comprehensive Cleanup Session

This cleanup focuses on three main priorities:
1. **Remove all unnecessary logging** - Console statements throughout codebase
2. **Clean up redundant functions** - Duplicate or similar functions
3. **Clean up dead code** - Unused imports, variables, functions, and files

### Logging Cleanup Progress

**Files with console statements removed:**
- FishEditorCanvas.tsx: 28+ console statements
- app/api/cron/route.ts: 15+ console statements
- FishEditOverlay.tsx: 10+ console statements
- Multiple other files with excessive logging

**Total files processed:** 70+ files
**Console statements removed:** 300+

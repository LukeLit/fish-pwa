Design Document: Migrate Prompt Generator to New Surreal Alien 3-Up Style + fal.ai Grok Imagine
Goal
Fully update the prompt generator in the fish editor to produce the new high-quality surreal alien painterly style we achieved in Grok Imagine testing.
All generations will run through fal.ai using the exact model that produced our best results:
Model: xai/grok-imagine-image (Grok Imagine Image / Aurora-powered)
API Details (fal.ai)

Primary endpoint: xai/grok-imagine-image
For text-to-image (main sprite generation): use the standard queue/submit
For future mouth animation frames (open/closed bite): use the image-to-image editing endpoint → xai/grok-imagine-image/edit
Pass the full prompt as prompt
For editing: also pass image_url (or base64) of the base sprite
Resolution target: 832×1248 (the model handles this well and gives clean vertical 3-up results)

Target Visual Style (make this dominant in every generated prompt)
Digital painting style, rich painterly brushwork, vibrant surreal alien concept art illustration, organic fleshy biomechanical textures, clustered glowing alien eyes, bulbous eye-covered nodules and growths, long flowing tentacle-like sensory barbels, iridescent shifting bioluminescent patterns, dark mesmerizing horror-beauty alien vibe, visible brush strokes, artistic rendering.
Required Layout (always enforce)
Vertical 3-stage growth sprite:

Small juvenile at the top (approximately half the size of the elder)
Medium adult in the middle
Large elder at the bottom
Generous clear space between each fish for easy automated slicing with no overlap
All three fish in clean right-facing side profile (head pointing right, tail pointing left)
Entire composition fits perfectly in 832×1248 canvas

Background (very strict – push hard)
PERFECTLY SOLID uniform bright cyan background exactly #00FFFF across the entire image, completely flat single-color background with ZERO gradients, ZERO shading, ZERO noise, ZERO particles, ZERO lighting effects, ZERO depth, ZERO caustics, ZERO atmospheric effects — the background must be a perfectly flat, unchanging solid color block with no variation whatsoever.
Consistency Rules

All three stages use the exact same primary skin color (pull from fish data: upper body/back + belly countershade)
Perfectly consistent colors, patterns, eyes, tentacles, growths across all stages
All three fish have similarly sized large prominent glowing alien eyes (juvenile looks cute due to big eyes on small body)

Recommended Full Prompt Template (use this structure in the generator)
textDigital painting style, rich painterly brushwork, vibrant surreal alien concept art illustration, vertical 3-stage growth sprite for a 2.5D fish game, 

three distinct growth phases of the exact same fish stacked vertically with generous clear space between them for easy automated slicing with no overlap: small juvenile at the top (approximately half the size of the elder), medium adult in the middle, large elder at the bottom, all three fish in clean right-facing side profile (head pointing right, tail pointing left),

PERFECTLY SOLID uniform bright cyan background exactly #00FFFF across the entire image, completely flat single-color background with ZERO gradients, ZERO shading, ZERO noise, ZERO particles, ZERO lighting effects, ZERO depth, ZERO caustics, ZERO atmospheric effects — the background must be a perfectly flat, unchanging solid color block with no variation whatsoever,

all three fish must use the exact same primary skin color: [PRIMARY_HEX] upper body and back, [BELLY_HEX] belly and lower sides countershading, perfectly consistent colors, patterns, and design language across all growth stages,

all three fish have similarly sized eyes (making the small juvenile look cute with big eyes relative to its body),



painterly digital art, visible brush strokes, artistic rendering, high detail with painterly quality, dramatic yet stylized lighting only on the fish, dark mesmerizing horror-beauty alien vibe, fits perfectly in 832x1248 canvas
Implementation Notes for the Code

Replace the old base prompt with the new template above.
Dynamically insert the fish’s primary color hex values.
Keep your existing chunk system, but prepend the new style/layout/background block and append the painterly closing line.
Remove or deprioritize old phrases like “clean cell-shaded”, “hard edges”, “strong silhouette”, “readable at small sizes”, “no black outlines”.
For fal.ai calls: set model: "xai/grok-imagine-image" and resolution to 832×1248 when possible.

Prompt:

Digital painting style, rich painterly brushwork, vibrant surreal alien concept art illustration, vertical 3-stage growth sprite for a 2.5D fish game, 

three distinct growth phases of the exact same fish stacked vertically with generous clear space between them for easy automated slicing with no overlap: small juvenile at the top (approximately half the size of the elder), medium adult in the middle, large elder at the bottom, all three fish in clean right-facing side profile (head pointing right, tail pointing left),

PERFECTLY SOLID uniform bright cyan background exactly #00FFFF across the entire image, completely flat single-color background with ZERO gradients, ZERO shading, ZERO noise, ZERO particles, ZERO lighting effects, ZERO depth, ZERO caustics, ZERO atmospheric effects — the background must be a perfectly flat, unchanging solid color block with no variation whatsoever,

all three fish must use the exact same primary skin color: upper body and back #9ca3af, belly and lower sides #e5e7eb countershading, perfectly consistent colors, patterns, and design language across all growth stages,

all three fish have similarly sized large prominent glowing alien eyes (making the small juvenile look cute with big eyes relative to its body),

surreal alien aesthetic: organic fleshy textures, clustered glowing alien eyes on head and body, bulbous eye-covered nodules and growths, long flowing tentacle-like sensory barbels, iridescent shifting bioluminescent patterns on scales, powerful streamlined fusiform body of a massive apex predator, rows of sharp serrated teeth visible, very prominent tall triangular dorsal fin, strong caudal fin,

painterly digital art, visible brush strokes, artistic rendering, high detail with painterly quality, dramatic yet stylized lighting only on the fish, dark mesmerizing horror-beauty alien vibe, fits perfectly in 832x1248 canvas

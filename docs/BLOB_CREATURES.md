## Workflow

- **Add more fish:** Add entries to `docs/biomes/*.md`, then run `npx tsx scripts/batch-generate-fish.ts` (skips existing).
- **Add tiers/stats to existing:** Run `npx tsx scripts/batch-update-creature-metadata.ts`.
- **Refresh this list:** Run `npx tsx scripts/export-creature-list.ts`.

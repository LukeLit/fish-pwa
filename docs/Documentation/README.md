# Documentation

Organized documentation for the Fish PWA project. This folder is the canonical source for architecture and system docs; older docs in `docs/unsorted/` are being phased out gradually.

## Contents

- **[Canvas systems](canvas-systems.md)** – FishEditorCanvas architecture: game loop, rendering, spawn sync, input, and related modules.

# AI-Generated Fish Models

This directory stores downloaded 3D fish models generated by Meshy.ai.

## How It Works

1. When a fish is generated via the Hunyuan API, the GLB model is downloaded from Tencent Cloud
2. The model is saved here with a cache key filename (e.g., `mutant_20_default.glb`)
3. Future requests for the same fish type/size/seed will use the cached local file
4. Model metadata is stored in browser localStorage to track cached models across sessions

## Benefits

- **Save API Credits**: Never regenerate the same model twice
- **Faster Loading**: Local files load instantly vs waiting for API + download
- **Offline Support**: Models work even without internet once downloaded

## File Naming

Format: `{type}_{size}_{seed}.glb`
- `type`: prey, predator, or mutant
- `size`: fish size parameter
- `seed`: unique identifier for reproducibility

## Note

These files are gitignored to avoid committing large binary files to version control.
Each developer will build their own local cache as they use the app.

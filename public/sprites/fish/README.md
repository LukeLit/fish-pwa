# AI-Generated Fish Sprites

This directory stores fish sprites generated by Black Forest Labs Flux 2 Pro via Vercel AI Gateway.

## How It Works

1. When a fish sprite is generated, Flux 2 Pro creates a high-quality image
2. The image is returned as base64 and cached in localStorage
3. Future requests for the same fish type/seed use the cached data
4. Sprite metadata is stored in browser localStorage

## Benefits

- **Save API Costs**: ~$0.04-0.06 per image, never regenerate the same sprite
- **Faster Loading**: Cached images load instantly
- **High Quality**: Flux 2 Pro produces excellent results comparable to DALL-E
- **Actually Works**: Uses Vercel AI Gateway, no region errors or subscription walls

## File Naming

Format: `fish_sprite_{type}_{seed}.png`
- `type`: prey, predator, or mutant
- `seed`: unique identifier for reproducibility

## Cost

- Flux 2 Pro: ~$0.04-0.06 per image
- Can generate 17-25 unique fish for $1
- Much cheaper than 3D model generation
- Works with Vercel AI Gateway funds

# Think Before Suggesting Alternatives

Before suggesting alternative approaches or tools, STOP and verify:

## 1. Does it actually solve the problem?

For this game, players generate NEW fish dynamically (mutations, fusions). Any animation system must:
- Work automatically for any generated sprite
- Require zero human intervention
- Maintain visual consistency

## 2. Will it produce consistent results?

- ❌ Text-to-image for animation frames = different fish in each frame
- ❌ Manual tools (Spine/Rive) = requires human work per fish  
- ✅ Image-to-video (Veo) = animates the actual sprite consistently

## 3. Test expensive APIs thoroughly BEFORE deployment

For paid APIs like Veo (~$4/video):
1. Test the COMPLETE flow locally first
2. Verify every step: auth, download, storage
3. Add safeguards (operation backups, recovery endpoints) BEFORE running
4. Don't iterate on production with real money

## 4. Don't suggest half-baked alternatives

If an alternative sounds cheaper but doesn't actually work for the use case, don't suggest it. The right expensive tool beats the wrong cheap tool.
